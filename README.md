# A. Administrative 

## 1. Notes

- Make sure that that you have read and understood all the tasks marked with "IMPORTANT" such as this task
- I am happy to advise you but please keep in mind that I am travelling a lot and I am not too often in FRA. For this reason, we will also have to rely on telcos and video conferences. If this is OK for you, then I am willing to advise you. By proceeding the thesis advisory process, you confirm that this is OK with you.
- Because we might not be able to have too many physical meetings, you will get my cell phone number such that you can call me if problems occur. You can also on short term notice send me WhatsApps. With this meausure we have to compromise that I am not too often in Frankfurt
- If you are not happy with this mode, please contact me. We might come to the conclusion that my mode of advising you does not fit with your demands, which is perfectly OK. Just want to mention these points to not raise expectations I cannot hold.
- Philipp Sandner typically is 1st advisor of your thesis. The student typically recruits the 2nd advisor. In emergency cases, we can deviate from this rule and Philipp can also recommend a 2nd advisor. But the responsibility to handle this process/task, is with the student.

## 2. Communication/Contact

- Concerning Philipp (supervisor), the best way to contact me is via Whatsapp or email.

## 3. Trello
- If you want somebody to really read a message or a comment you post on a task, then type in "@personID" or another person. Otherwise he or she might not see this comment. By checking this task, yon confirm that you have understood this.

## 4. File Sharing
There are different methods for file sharing, which I found to be useful with trello:

- **Smaller decisions or priorizations** (e.g. "which of the brands should I pick as a use case for creating a prototype?" / "Which of these 10 interview partners should I approach for my 5 interviews?") -> Please create a checklist in trello. So we can easily prioritize by drag&drop and clicking
- **Lists with more than two columns and a lot of rows** -> Please use Google Spreadsheets and post an editable link, so that I can access the file
- **Longer Text documents** -> Please use Google Docs and post an editable link, so that I can access the file

## 5. Writing Tips

- Google ***how to write a research paper*** and ***how to structure a research paper***
- **How to draft beautiful figures**: check working papers from top consulting companies: McKinsey, PwC, Deloitte. Try to imitate their style: font, font size, color, boxes etc. then your Figures also will look nice. For instance, google ***mckinsey.de filetype:pdf studie -pressemitteilung***
