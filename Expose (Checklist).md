***Developing a Blockchain-based system for Passive Asset Management Using Tokenization of a Meta-token and Data from ITSA Global in the Context of Decentralized Finance***


## Gerneral Description of the Topic

In this century, we have been witnessing how Blockchain Technology has greatly influenced the financial sector and created a new concept of the so called Decentralized Finance, or DeFi for short. This new area of Finance makes use of P2P networking to enable parties to send and receive funds without the need of a centralized authority such as a bank. 

The first DeFi application dates back to 2008 when the cryptocurrency Bitcoin was introduced as an innovation for electronic payment by using peer-to-peer (P2P) network (Nakamoto, S., 2008), creating a new and independent way of transfering digital assets compared to the traditional methods such as online banking or credit cards. Since then, Bitcoin along with its enabling Blockchain Technology have become a hype in the financial as well as the IT sectors. The hype, however, did not stop there at Bitcoin, as in 2013, the Ethereum blockchain was proposed with the concept of Smart Contract (Buterin, V., 2014), which goes beyond the idea of transferring digital assets and allows entities on the network to not only trade and exchange funds, but also to execute code on the distributed Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), adding another layer of automation and security for P2P digital asset exchange. As a result, Smart Contracts provides the ability to employ many other cryptocurrencies, in the form of Smart Contract tokens, alongside the main cryptocurrency Ether, on top of the Ethereum network, therefore, providing more flexibility for network entities to deploy their own means of exchanging assets. At present, Bitcoin and Ether are the most popular cryptocurrencies in DeFi, however, there are many more on the market such as Tether, Binance, LiteCoin, ChainLink to name a few, which are ethereum-based tokens serving different purposes.

As of January 2021, there are 354,191 Token Contracts on the Ethereum mainnet (www.etherscan.io/tokens) and most of these tokens are compliant with the ERC-20 Token Standard and distributed through initial coin offerings (ICOs). With the large amount of cryptographic tokens available, there arises a need for identification, classification and analysis of tokens, which is the motivation behind the International Token Standardization Association (ITSA). This thesis aims to support these goals of the ITSA by implementing a Metatoken that encapsulates a subset of the most representative tokens of the Ethereum network to serve as a measurement of the token market's health, much like the stock market indices such as DJ30, S&P 500 or DAX30.

## Research Questions

- How does the tokenization of a Metatoken for passive asset management on the blockchain work?
- What are the possible approaches to evaluate and integrate the proposed Metatoken from a set of many existing tokens on the Ethereum network?
- What are the possible security issues of the proposed system? 
- What are the differences between the proposed Metatoken system and the existing solutions e.g. from Chainlink, TokenSet and Melonport?

## Expected Outcomes (Which findings would be interesting, why?)

**Challenges**:
- Understand tokenization and build a Metatoken that encapsulates many existing tokens
- Understand ITSA data and make it accessible from the Blockchain using Oracles
- Evaluate and integrate the created Metatoken (i.e. 10% of all tokens integrated after 1 month) similar to a DAX Index.
**Optional**:
- Compare and evaluate through a case study the architecture of melonport.com,dforce.com and tokensets with the developed prototype
**Success Factors**:
- A Metatoken entity is created on the Ethereum network
- A working onchain-offchain asynchronous mechanism that calls a list of tokens from the ITSA API and writing the result on the blockchain.
- The Metatoken implements a smart rebalancing logic regarding the selection of token set.

## Relevance of the research from the theoretical and practical perspective
- **Theoretical perspective**: The thesis seeks to demonstrate the feasibility of tokenizing a Metatoken on the Ethereum network for passive asset management. Thereby, it aims to contribute more relevant research to the area of Decentrilized Finance in general and passive asset mangement on the Ethereum blockchain in particular. 

- **Practical perspective**: The outcome of the thesis could be developed upon to have a real-world DeFi system of a Metatoken for the cryptographic token market on the Ethereum mainnet. Furthermore, it provides token investors an alternative investing option by investing in Metatokens instead of the individual tokens.
