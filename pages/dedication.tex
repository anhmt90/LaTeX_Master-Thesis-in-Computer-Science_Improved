%TODO: Dedication

This thesis is dedicated to my late father, who has passed away during the time this thesis was in progress. As a teacher himself, my father has sacrificed many things in his life for my education, without him, I would not have the opportunity to be here studying in Germany. Unfortunately, the day of my graduation will be without his presence.
